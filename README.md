MHNibLoading
============

MHNibLoading aims to eliminate some of boilerplate code commonly seen when loading `UIView`s from a nib on disk. The library is most useful when the `UIView` subclass and it's corresponding nib file have the same name.  It provides category methods on `UIView` to load either individual `UIView` instances or `UINib` instances from on-disk *.xib files. 

# Usage

### Setup

Create your *.xib file, its corresponding UIView subclass, and set the class identity for the *.xib file in the Xcode Identity Inspector.  If you want to take advantage of implicit nib loading, make sure to give the *.xib file and your `UIView` subclass the same name.  For example, `MyWidgetView.xib` and `MyWidgetView.[h,m]`.

### Code

Usage is as follows

```objc

@implementation MyWidgetController

- (void)loadView
{
	// Basic usage
	self.view = [MyWidgetView loadInstanceFromNib];

	// For special cases (e.g., instantiating 100s of views), UINibs can be created too
	UINib *nib = [MyWidgetView loadNib];
	UIView *myWidgetView = [nib instantiateWithOwner:self options:nil];
}

@end

```
